About Arcade

Arcade’s mission is to empower the Product Led Growth Economy. We aspire to support the future generation of founders by helping them tell the stories of their products and helping future customers discover these products. This will in turn provide economic freedom to builders.

Culturally, we are a team of ex-Atlassians, AngelList, Shopify, and Twitter teammates — we believe in empowering the end user, and unifying companies around the needs of the end user. We believe that we have the potential to change how software companies work.

While we are a globally distributed team, we would prefer to bring in new team members to work in a hybrid environment based in our San Francisco, CA office.

What you’ll do

Arcade is the easiest story-telling tool for companies to tell the stories of their products, and these stories are the most engaging way for future customers to discover amazing products that will change their lives.

We are looking for product-minded engineers that will empathize with our customer’s needs and work closely with our users and the rest of the team to bring creative ideas to the product. We are a small but mighty engineering team which means you will have full ownership of your projects, including deliverables and timeline.

In concrete terms, our next engineering hires will own one of our key initiatives and bring it to life. Those initiatives are currently:


Build many core functionalities that make Arcade the easiest story-telling tool such as more intuitive and powerful animation tools, while keeping users’ learning curve at zero.
Build many core features that make the resulting Arcades super engaging such as “choose your own adventure” logic to the stories.


We have more on the roadmap and these initiatives are what we’re currently targeting.

On the front end, our stack is heavily Jamstack-based with Next.js, Typescript, as well as a Chrome Extension. On the back end, we use GCP (Firestore, Cloud Functions, PubSub, IdP, and a few other services) and AWS (Aurora). Arcades are embedded on our users site, which means we strive for high-performing code and we must maintain high performance to make that work well.

Who you are

First and foremost, you’re someone who not only enjoys the idea of building something from scratch but also thrives in a highly autonomous environment. We want someone who is ready to build, iterate, and ship at speed and loves it. You’re also open to dialogue and a feedback culture, kind, open-minded, and excited about bringing other top-tier people to the team and building something great.

Skills and Qualifications


Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field (or equivalent experience).
5+ years of full stack engineering experience.
Strong proficiency in front-end technologies like Next.js, React, Typescript, and/or Chrome Extensions.

Arcade started with a simple idea: why not make your product interactive so customers can try it before buying? Our mission is to empower the product-led growth economy. We aspire to support the next generation of founders by helping them tell the stories of their products and helping future customers discover these products. This will, in turn, provide economic freedom to builders.

At Arcade, we believe in 'Demo-Driven Development'. It's the concept of moving fast—shipping, learning, failing, and winning fast. Interactive demos—like Arcade—allow teams to understand why, how, and where their audience gets value from their products. More than 10,000 teams leverage Arcade to tell better, more engaging product stories, and we need your help spreading the word! Culturally, we are a team of ex-Atlassians, AngelList, and Shopify teammates. We believe in building easy-to-use and beautiful products and that we have the potential to change how software companies showcase their product at every stage.

While we are a globally distributed team, we would prefer to bring new team members into a hybrid work environment based in our San Francisco, CA office. This is a nice-to-have; not a requirement.
About the role:
We’re looking for a creative and eager marketer to own the scaling of our demand generation engine. You will be crucial in driving revenue growth through strategic marketing initiatives supporting our self-serve. You will work closely with the sales and product teams to align efforts, run experiments, and use data and analytics to measure and improve performance.

You fit this role if you enjoy storytelling, have a bias for action, and are excited about having creative reins to define and build our top-of-the-funnel strategy. We want someone who is ready to build, iterate, and ship at speed and loves it.
What you’ll do:
You’ll partner with the Head of Marketing to take our acquisition efforts to the next level. The scope of this role includes:


Own channels: Build and execute multi-channel demand gen strategies to drive measurable growth across new and existing channels: paid search, paid social, retargeting, email, SEO, partnerships, community, etc.
Ideate and run experiments: Partner with the go-to-market team to run consistent experiments in and out-of-product.
Develop relationships: Identify and build relationships with partners, influencers, and communities to increase brand awareness and foster customer champions.
Storytelling: Identify opportunities to develop stories and campaigns that drive discovery and adoption of Arcade — such as customer stories, best practices, and product development.

Who you are:Must have:

Bias to action: You are proactive and can take a project from concept to completion. Moving quickly and learning fast excites you. If you see an anomaly, your instinct is to dive in and figure it out.
Analytical: You can analyze and optimize campaigns at each customer journey stage, leveraging A/B testing and other optimization techniques to improve performance and make data-driven decisions.
Creative: You can develop campaign concepts and brainstorm new ways to market Arcade across different channels.
Integrator: You can effectively define and communicate your efforts and bring functions together to execute your plans.

Nice to have:

Storyteller: You are highly skilled at understanding the customer's voice and translating that into content and campaigns that engage and resonate with our core personas.
Visual taste: This role involves generating content (often with Arcade!) and building brand awareness. You have a keen eye for great design and aesthetics and know that the details matter.
Technical experience: You’re passionate about utilizing best-in-class marketing tools, enjoy solving technical challenges, and have a knack for optimizing workflows.
Sales exposure: You understand sales techniques and strategies and have experience developing nurture campaigns to move deals through the pipeline.

About Appsmith

Appsmith is an open-source, low code software that helps developers build applications quickly, usually within only hours.

Since being introduced less than two years ago, Appsmith’s open source software has more than 10 million downloads, more than 31,000 stars on Github and is used at over 10,000 organizations across 150 countries.

We are a global and fully remote organization, excited to welcome new teammates to our collaborative environment and high-performance culture.

See our GitHub repo here: https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith

Company Vision

We believe every organization should have the ability to develop high performing internal applications quickly and cost-effectively. Every enterprise needs to create custom internal applications, spending between 10% to 40% of their engineering resources on them. Yet they often take a backseat to customer-facing applications because they are challenging, expensive and slow to build. Appsmith is already enabling software engineers to transform how they build internal apps, often building them 10 times faster with Appsmith. In the future we’re building, custom software developed for internal users will look and work no differently than the best out-of-the-box SAAS products. Internal users will demand great UX, great customer support, and great reliability from their in-house development teams because Appsmith has made it quick and painless for developers to build, deploy and maintain custom software.

What do we value?

Above all, we value a growth mindset. As a team of learners, we read, talk to people and listen to feedback constantly. We love working with people who have strong opinions, weakly held. Self starters and ambitious people form the backbone of our team. Do you want to work on bigger projects? Are you comfortable setting large goals and then accomplishing them? We value consistency and reliability. For example, sticking to committed deadlines, showing up on time etc. We believe that predictability makes teams run a lot smoother. It’s the little things that matter. Attention to detail shows that we empathize with our users, our colleagues and anyone else that we interact with. Are you a practical optimist? Our founding team strongly believes in a better future. We believe in playing our part to make that future a reality.

What will you be doing?

As a tech support engineer at Appsmith, you may require to provide help to our users to debug a database connection.
